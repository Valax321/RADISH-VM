# RADISH-VM

A fantasy console/system project in which games target a custom RISC architecture.

The project offers a game runtime, a set of C system headers for the system and a custom Clang backend that emits RADISH-VM machine code.

Would also be good to have a higher-level scripting language available like other fantasy consoles (RADISH BASIC!)
